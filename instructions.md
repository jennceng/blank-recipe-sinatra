###Instructions
1.  When a user accesses the home page of your website they should be redirected to '/ingredients'

2.  When a user goes to '/' or '/ingredients' they should see items from your `ingredients.txt` file as individual list items

2.  Add a form to the homepage that allows a user to post new ingredients for the recipe that writes to the `ingredients.txt` file and redirects them to the homepage to see the updated list
